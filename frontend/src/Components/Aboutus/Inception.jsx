        Founded in 1990 by Mr. P.S. Choudhary, Choudhary Tours &amp; Travels Pvt. Ltd. (CTTPL) began
        with a vision to transform transportation services across India. What started as a small
        operation has evolved into a vast network spanning eight major cities and a fleet strength
        of over 4000 vehicles. CTTPL’s journey has been shaped by a deep commitment to customer
        safety, integrity, and innovation. Today, under the leadership of Mr. Rajeev Choudhary,
        CEO, and Mr. Sandeep Choudhary, Joint Managing Director, CTTPL stands as a trusted partner
        in corporate and public transportation, offering a wide range of services—from employee
        and school transport to car leasing and sustainable electric fleets. Our story is one of
        growth, driven by a mission to contribute positively to the communities we serve and to set
        new standards in the transportation industry.
